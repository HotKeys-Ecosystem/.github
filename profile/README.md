# HotKeys - Software Licensing made easy for professionals.

## Introduction
HotKeys is an SDK/Utility that allows companies to issue NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) for every new purchase of their software products. This provides a better transfer mechanism for users as they can easily manage a lot of plugins with just one wallet. Additionally, for companies, every resale generates a percentage of the money earned from the purchase.

## Target Audience
HotKeys is primarily targeted towards creative professionals and gamers who use multiple software products, especially video editors, music producers, and gamers who purchase plugins or in-game items. They often find it difficult to maintain their product keys, especially when switching between machines.

## The Benefits of NFTs as Software Keys
HotKeys is designed to solve the challenges that arise from the traditional product key mechanism. Using NFTs offers several benefits over traditional product keys:

Better transfer mechanism: NFTs provide a better transfer mechanism as they can be easily managed and stored in a single wallet.

Increased revenue: Companies can earn a percentage of the money earned from every resale of their software products.

Reduced fraud: NFTs offer increased security and reduced fraud as they cannot be duplicated or copied.

## Getting Started
To get started with HotKeys, you will need to create an account on our platform. Once you have created an account, you can issue NFTs for your software products. Users who purchase your software will receive the NFT in their provided wallet.

## Roadmap
Our current roadmap includes building on the Solana blockchain to reduce gas fees associated with NFT transfer. Additionally, we plan to work with more companies to adopt the HotKeys mechanism for their software products.

## Conclusion
HotKeys offers a revolutionary way for companies to issue product keys, providing users with a better transfer mechanism and allowing companies to earn a percentage of money earned from every resale. We believe that HotKeys will revolutionize the software industry and make it easier for users to manage multiple software products.
