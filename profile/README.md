## Description: </br>

**Software Keys are hard to manage.**

- You need different product keys to authenticate each product you own, and managing them all is a pain. and if you're switching your work machine by any chance, you would have to verify each of them with their separate key.

- Key Resale on stores like g2a, is one the huge reasons of revenue loss for such product developers. Hotkeys helps tackle this as well.
- Every product key is just a random string of characters, with Hotkeys you can customise your keys with your brand identity. Software Keys catered to your product.


**How Does [HotKeys](https://hotkeys.vercel.app/) help?**

Hotkeys aims to fix UX around the software key community by replacing the traditional software keys with NFT's.

 - ***Simple UX*** </br>
Used to have a file with all your text based keys everytime you needed to verify? now you just need to connect your wallet and you're done. it's that simple.

 - ***No Resale*** </br>
Keys can be resold, decreasing developer's revenue, now you have option to configure to render the key useless whenever it's transferred.

 - ***Customisability*** </br>
Instead of string of characters no one understands, use your brand, from logo to metadata you can customise everything about key.




**Onboarding**

You can refer to our [Docs](https://hotkeysinc.gitbook.io/hotkeyssdk/) to understand our product more, plus how to integrate the sdk with your payments infrastructure.

**Roadmap**

We're planning to actually add more support overtime, with apis.

**Some Use Cases-**
- A marketplace like Open Sea but for softwares, you can buy softwares, sell softwares yourself without worrying about a payments and verification infrastructure. From Game Mods, to DAW plugins the possibilites can be endless.

- For a company who's already selling software and uses product keys, can better the ux for users and themselves by using Hotkeys instead of traditional alphanumeric keys.
