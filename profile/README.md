## Introduction
HotKeys is an SDK that allows companies to issue NFTs(Non-Fungible Tokens) rather than hex keys for every new purchase of their software products. This provides a better transfer mechanism for users as they can easily manage a lot of plugins with just one wallet. Additionally, for companies, every resale generates a percentage of the money earned from the purchase.

## Target Audience
HotKeys is primarily targeted towards software companies selling multiple software products, also creative professionals like video editors, music producers, and gamers who purchase plugins or in-game items. They often find it difficult to maintain their product keys, especially when switching between machines.

## The Benefits of NFTs as Software Keys
HotKeys is designed to solve the challenges that arise from the traditional product key mechanism. Using NFTs offers several benefits over traditional product keys:

Better transfer mechanism: NFTs provide a better transfer mechanism as they can be easily managed and stored in a single wallet.

Increased revenue: Companies can earn a percentage of the money earned from every resale of their software products.
