**Software Keys are hard to manage.**

Being a creative professional, dependent upon various plugins, for your choice of software, whether it may be colour grade LUT for premiere pro or FCP or some audio sampler for your music production daw. you need different product keys to authenticate each of those plugins, and managing them is a pain. and if you're switching your work machine by any chance, you would have to verify each of them with their separate key, not very user friendly.

From a developer's perspective who's creating such plugins or even products, key resale on stores like g2a, is one the huge reasons of their revenue loss. People sell the product key on such marketplaces after use, at a cheaper price, which decreases the amount of new customers you can get. Hotkeys helps to tackle that as well.

**How Does HotKeys help?**

Hotkeys aims to fix UX around the software key community by replacing the traditional software keys with NFT's.

So users can leverage the benefits such as better management and transferability when it comes to software keys. For creative professionals, instead of maintaining a notepad full of keys, they can leverage their crypto wallet to authenticate the products/plugins they own just by the NF'Key’s they own!

also, this makes transferability easier, instead of selling their key in a unsafe marketplace, where the buyer and seller would have to have trust, like how old windows activation keys are sold, they can just transfer that particular NFT. 

Companies being the creator of the said NFkey, could configure to either render the key the unusable as it is transferred, to prevent resale and save their revenue, or get a original creator royalty whenever it is transferred.

**Onboarding**

Hotkeys, provides a Typescript SDK, as of now, which would allow developers to integrate it with their payments infra, so for every new purchase they would mint an NF'Key of their own and transfer it to the user's wallet. As for the gas fees, Companies can include an estimate gas fees with the product itself, whilst paying the gas in their backend so for the user the experience would be seamless, they wouldn't need to have gas tokens themselves.

Now to make onboarding even better for developers, we're working on api's which adds another layer of abstraction to our SDK, companies can self host these api's, so they have one place to manage all keys infra, they can setup custom rpc's their, rather in their main codebase and alter it according to their needs.

**Roadmap**

We're planning to actually add more support overtime, with apis.

**Example Use Case-**

Imagine this idea of marketplace, which would allow users to own softwares/plugins/products, where basically we’re using hotkeys to manage all infra, like open sea but for any sort of product, where the ownership of that product/softwares can be defined by those **NFkeys**. Indie developers creating games, or game mods, basically devs or folks who would like to bring something out which is their creation, without actually taking care of a payments infra, and monetisation. here, the possibilities can be endless. Something like proof of ownership of softwares, products.
